                <h3>Action research</h3>
                <p>Action research is generally undertaken by practitioners in order to help develop their practice,
                    although it can
                    also be research with practitioners. The aim of this approach is to change practice by problem
                    solving, which
                    normally requires an intervention into the proceedings on the part of the researcher or
                    practitioner. It usually
                    begins with small changes that one single person can implement and then, if these are successful,
                    the changes become
                    gradually more extensive and widespread.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text reveal2">
                <h3>Case study</h3>
                <p>Case studies entail the detailed and intensive analysis of a single case: this could be a programme,
                    event,
                    organisation, phenomenon or one or more individuals. It is important to be clear about the
                    boundaries of the case.
                    The researcher collects data using a variety of collection methods over a period of time to shed
                    light onto the
                    case.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text reveal3">
                <h3>Experimental design</h3>
                <p>Experimental designs allow researchers to not only observe events, but also to control and even
                    manipulate the
                    conditions associated with them in order to find out what happens. This enables researchers to
                    deliberately
                    introduce a predetermined factor and measure the differences that result from the intervention while
                    controlling for
                    all other factors that might influence the outcome.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text reveal4">
                <h3>Ethnography</h3>
                <p>Ethnographic studies involve collecting data over a period of time through immersion in the field.
                    This is usually to
                    study the culture of a setting, behaviours, structures and values. The researcher acts as a
                    participant observer in
                    a natural setting. By becoming integrated into their field of research, they have opportunities to
                    understand what
                    takes place there and an increasing understanding of which data is relevant to collect to help
                    understand what is
                    observable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text reveal5">
                <h3>Longitudinal studies and surveys</h3>
                <p>Longitudinal studies collect data over an extended period of time, with the data being repeatedly
                    collected on a
                    sample (of people, documents, etc.) on at least two occasions, but sometimes over many years. A good
                    example of this
                    would be the <em>Child of our Time</em> BBC documentary series, which plans to run for 20 years,
                    following its 25
                    subjects from their birth in 1999 or 2000.</p>
                <p>Surveying by interview or questionnaire is useful in gathering information from a wide range of
                    people to look for
                    patterns, as well as potential trends about particular phenomena or issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text reveal6">
                <h3>Narrative and biographical approaches</h3>
                <p>Narrative research encourages participants to tell their own story, in their own words, rather than
                    answering a set
                    of questions devised by researchers. Biographical research is a particular form of narrative
                    research in which
                    participants are encouraged to see their experiences in the context of their lives as a whole, with
                    researchers
                    seeking to understand the diverse influences that have shaped people&rsquo;s lives. Narrative and
                    biographical
                    approaches explore how different actors involved in a particular situation or process actually
                    experience it, and
                    therefore provide rich evidence that can contribute to the development of more appropriate policies
                    and practices.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text reveal7">
                <h3>Critical discourse analysis</h3>
                <p>Critical discourse analysis is the study of language in use in the world. It explores how language is
                    used to not
                    only say things, but also to actually <em>do</em> things in the world. As a research design, it
                    focuses on texts
                    &ndash; written, spoken or visual &ndash; and the relationships between language and power and is
                    interested in how
                    texts reproduce inequalities. Discourse analysis conceptualises language as constitutive of social
                    practice. Thus,
                    words we use inscribe our reality as much as they describe. They construct a particular version of
                    the world. Power
                    is understood as the ability of a social group to set the material conditions within which
                    individuals as members of
                    social groups live, learn and think. Power and domination may be coercive, but when worked through
                    as discourse it
                    creates willing, compliant subjects by producing and reproducing meaning. Discourses are
                    far-reaching and pervasive.
                    The study of discourse focuses on the detail of language but connects this to social, cultural and
                    political
                    meanings.</p>

                <h3>Literature reviewing</h3>
                <p>Literature reviewing is central to your research. It is through the literature that you acquire an
                    understanding of
                    your topic, what research has been done on it, what methods and methodologies are associated with it
                    and what the
                    key issues are. Literature reviewing allows you to develop understanding of the main theories around
                    your subject
                    and the varying ways in which it has been conceptualised, applied or changed. Through the literature
                    you will become
                    critically aware of the strengths and weaknesses of different theoretical stances and position
                    yourself and your
                    research within an ongoing debate</p>
                <p>The purpose of a literature review is to also enable you to identify the gaps in research that your
                    research question
                    aims to explore.</p>
